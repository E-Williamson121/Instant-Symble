# Instant-Symble
This project is a spinoff of the popular wordle-like game, Symble. It was inspired by both Symble (by Daniel Baaumonde) and Instant Wordle (by Wooferzfg). The influences of both are probably fairly visible in the end result (the overall puzzle design and interface layout resembles instant wordle, while the gameplay is very similar to symble)

The project uses a puzzle list which was found using various python searching scripts (included in this repository). The current list (puzzlesv5.txt) has 1000 puzzles, but I'll probably be adding more at a later time, and prior versions are still included for rollback purposes.

This being my first ever .js project, the code for the main.js script is admittedly quite messy. Neither the python scripts nor the main.js script are properly documented, I'll try to add proper documentation at some point down the line.

Please do contact me if any bugs are found. I would not be surprised if there are quite a few on release.
